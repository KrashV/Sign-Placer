# Starbound Sign Placer
Place custom signs in one click

# Installation

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/KrashV/Sign-Placer/releases) and unpack it into your mods folder:
> /Starbound/mods/Sign Placer

Download the [Animated Signs generator](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-AnimatedSigns) by Silverfeelin.

# Pre-Usage

After finishing setting up your signs in the generator, press `Create and Export` button. Now, you have to save it either inside Sign Placer mod or outside one.

We suggest to create a separate folder since the .pak file can be updated with future releases. So let's do that: in `mods` folder create a new one, i.e. `MySignsToPlace`

Let's say you called the folder "My First Picture". After pressing `Create and Export` button, navigate to
> /Starbound/mods/MySignsToPlace/put_signs_here

and put save your folder there. So the final path will look like
> /Starbound/mods/MySignsToPlace/put_signs_here/My First Picture

Now launch Starbound.

# Usage

In Starbound, open starting crafting menu (`C` by default) and craft Sign Placer: it's totally free!

Pressing Right Mouse button will open the User Interface, where you have to write the name of the folder you've put in the mod folder. In addition, you can select how many signs you want to generate (it is count from the bottom left corner).
When you're set, press Accept. If you typed it right, "All done" message will appear. Close the window but don't put the item away.

Now you can see your future picture: colored green mean you can place signs here safely, the red warns you that signs won't spawn there. When you find your spot, simply press Left Mouse Button, and voila! Profit!
